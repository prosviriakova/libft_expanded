# libft_expanded
For use in my projects for School 42, where it's allowed.

To compile with the file (in the same directory as libft):

```
gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -Iinclude main.c -o main -L. -lft
```
Additionally, ensure that the file being compiled with the library includes the header located at `include/libft.h`:
```
#include "include/libft.h"
```
